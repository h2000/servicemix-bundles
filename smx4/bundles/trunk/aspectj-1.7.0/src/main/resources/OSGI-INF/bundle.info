\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    Some aspects of system implementation, such as logging, error handling, standards enforcement
    and feature variations are notoriously difficult to implement in a modular way. The result is that code
    is tangled across a system and leads to quality, productivity and maintenance problems. AspectJ is a
    seamless aspect-oriented extension to the Java programming language that enables clean modularization of
    these 'crosscutting concerns'. For the best AspectJ development experience, the AspectJ Development Tools
    (AJDT) project provides Eclipse platform based tool support for AOSD with AspectJ.
